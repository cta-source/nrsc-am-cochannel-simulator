# Control and configuration file for graveyard.m
#
# Several parameters are set by this file.
# Comments (such as this line) begin with the "#" character
# and are ignored.
#
# First parameter: NIF
# Set NIF mode. NIF=1 for specified interferer amplitudes.
# NIF=0 for randomly set interferer amplitudes.
# If NIF=1, then the interferer amplitudes will be read
# from the file nif.txt which must be present. The number
# of values in the nif.txt file will be the number of
# interferers.
0
# Next are the numbers for the first and last interferers:
# nfile1
# nfile2
# For example if nfile1=10 and nfile2=13, then there will
# be four interferers. The audio will be taken from the
# files audio11.flac through audio14.flac. (Remember that
# the desired audio will be taken from the file audio01.flac
# so the first interferer audio will be audio02.flac.
# The nfile2 value will be ignored if NIF=1, and the nfile1
# value will be the first file number for the NIF mode.

# Set the average SNR in decibels. 10 dB is suggested.
# Higher values mean lower interference amplitude.
# The SNR will be the average SNR. Interferers will
# fade up and down in amplitude. The SNR will be worse
# than the specified value some of the time, and better at
# other times.
# This value is ignored if NIF=1.
10
# Set the audio type - flat or 75 microsecond pre-emphasized.
# A value of 0 here selects flat audio. A value of 1 selects
# pre-emphasized audio.
1
# Set the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in decibels. Higher
# values mean lower noise amplitude. If the value specified
# is higher than +90 (db), then NO noise will be added to
# the signal. The specified SNR value will specify the noise
# power within the receiver's bandwidth (typically 5 kHz,
# corresponding to a 2.5 kHz audio response), referred to
# the desired signal's carrier amplitude (set to 1.0).
